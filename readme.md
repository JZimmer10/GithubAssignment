### Interesting Fruits and Vegetables
For this assignment, we had to use UNIX commands and git in order to complete the assignment. We were tasked with make a directory for food with two subdirectories labeled _fruits_ and _vegetables_. Under the _fruits_ subdirectory, I listed:
1. Blueberry
2. Raspberry
3. Strawberry

As for the _vegetables_, the list that I made up consisted of:
1. Carrot
2. Tomato
3. Cucumber
