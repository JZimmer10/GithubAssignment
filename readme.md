### Interesting Fruits and Vegetables
For this assignment, we had to use UNIX commands and git in order to complete the assignment. We were tasked with make a directory for food with two subdirectories labeled _fruits_ and _vegetables_. Under the _fruits_ subdirectory, I listed:
* Blueberry
* Raspberry
* Strawberry

As for the _vegetables_, the list that I made up consisted of:
* Carrot
* Tomato
* Cucumber
